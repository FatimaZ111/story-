    <p>The cat… <br>
There was silence for a moment. Look I am trusting you but   it’s a risk.  That’s not trusting!  You have to let us go If he goes maybe he will not be able to bring that much food.<br>
Ah! Roxanne shouted. Everybody went over there Roxanne was awake. We told her what was happening. Roxanne you will stay because I don’t think you have fully recovered.<br>
 She agreed.You have to let us go, please. Ok Mrs. Sofia finally agreed.
</p>
<p>
I’ll help you get everything ready, quick. Ok. After few minutes of preparing and making rules we were ready to go.<br>
We all had mobiles so we had a voice call and with Mrs. Sofia too. We all had dark clothes so we couldn’t be spotted easily.<br>
Mrs. Sofia had a scared and a nervous face.</p>
<p>
We went saying our good byes. We were together. We were almost there. Quiet. We saw a mad person going over there.<br>
Dad! She whispers. We split up. We sneaked in from the back door of the mall. We were crouching. We saw Alex’s dad crouched, hiding from the mad person. We stayed there.<br>
 When the mad person was gone we crouched to him. What are you doing here? Long story. We took some stuff very careful.We divided the categories of food. Lizzy and I got breakfast.<br>
I went in the cereal aisle getting some cereals.While Lizzy was getting eggs. After that we took that we went to check on others they were ready.</p><br>
 <p>
We went home safely. Mrs. Sofia was delighted to see us. Ok now why were these kids there. Does it matter we helped you a lot Alex said? Aha agreed her dad. What did you get?<br>
 asked Mrs. Sofia. All of the foods I mean breakfast, lunch, supper, dinner and a little a bit of desert.Well the good news is Roxanne is alright.<br>
 Who’s ready for lunch! We all cheered. Mind a little help in the kitchen Lizzy. No problem mom. You can prepare the desert and I shall prepare the dinner Darling.<br>
The other of us played happily. Our mothers and fathers would keep calling us from the day we were here. we made loads of noise. The grandmother keeps telling us to quiet down but we don’t.<br>
 we don’t mean not to listen to her.</p>
 <p>
Thump! Thump! came the noises somebody was thumping on the door, everyone stared at the door. Come here boys and give me a hand. They put a small little cabinet in front <br>
 of the door it was not that big though not even that heavy I think it was like 24,25 kg.</p>
 <p>
Thump! Came the noise again. It’s going to be ok said Mr. Cody, Alex’s Father. And everyone went back to their work they were doing Thump! Thump! <br>
 The noise kept going for a minute or two. Then it got much louder! We all stopped what we were doing and stared at it, curious. Thump! Thump! What do we do now I asked? <br>
 Ok, if they get in you all need to hide don’t care about anything do as you are said take it seriously and quiet.We agreed. Boys put things in front of the door. We went there and <br>
  I put a little table in front of it. And we need to cooperate be friends with everybody in this house! Thump! </p>
<p>
 We could see that the door was about to break! Take weapons. we all took some stuff. Mr. Cody took a kitchen knife. I took a scissor form the kitchen my friend took a frying pan and <br>
 so did my friends took stuff.Quiet. We all got ready. The noise stopped There was silence no one moved a muscle. Then everybody sighed with relief.<br>
 And went to what they were doing after half an hour. Dinner is ready shouted Mrs. Sofia. We were in Alex’s room playing Brookhaven together. There was a delicious smell around.<br>
  We ran over there happily and curious that what was in dinner that smelled so good.
It was stew it smelled so good and it looked so delicious.</p>
<p>
    We went and sat on the dining table. Wow Mrs. Sofia this looks and smells delicious. Thanks. It was delicious. After dinner came the desert.<br>
     There was excitement in the air. Lizzy came in with a tray of some cold ice-cream. Yay! shouted Robert I love Ice0cream I bet you guys do too!<br>
      We all nodded our heads happily.</p>
      <p>
We dived in! After Half an hour of enjoying Ice-cream. We all sat happily and talked. Mr. Cody turned on the T.V.<br>
                                         T.V <br>

  There is more risk now! Yes, more risk. Then we all when to sleep, worried.</p>
  <p>
In the morning, I woke up. I went to the kitchen after brushing my teeth and there were pancakes topped with caramel. After breakfast Mr. Cody made us do study. Then he made us read a book, it <br>
was a little hard choosing my book there were just so many books to choose from. The book I choose was pretty nice!
We had to read for an hour, my book was still not finished.<br>
 Then I played roblox with everyone. After three hours of playing Roblox. We played among us for almost one and a half hour. It was really fun. Then one by one we got called for a bath. <br>
  After everyone took a bath. We were called for lunch.There was orange juice with some crunchy fried potatoes, I dident know its name. We ate our food. Do you know anything else <br>
   about this virus?
 I asked. No, maybe they will tell us more in the T.V saying this he turned on the TV.</p> <br>
                                <p> TV <br>
Host: This virus is spreading immensely!! If I guess how many rats have been infected this mysterious virus the number would be big…. I guess 3000 rats or more! Isent it a huge number of rats!<br>
 Oh! Another colony is calling in. let’s see what they want to say.<br>
